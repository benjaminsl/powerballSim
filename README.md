# powerballSim
Simulates someone buying one ticket for the powerball each day and finds out how long it would take to match certain number of balls

To compile either:
1. issue this command: gcc -Wall main.c options.c calc.c output.c -o powerballSim
2. or if you have make, issue this command: make

Then, the executable will be called "powerballSim" and will be in the same directory.

NOTE: It takes a very, very long time to match all 6 balls. 

For better efficieny, comment out the printf statements that show that generated numbers.
